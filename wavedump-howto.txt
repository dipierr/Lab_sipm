Digitizer CAEN DT 5751 and sw wavedump

To start the digitizer:
$ wavedump WaveDumpConfig.txt

The instrument configurations are set via WaveDumpConfig.txt file (e.g.: enabled channels, external trigger, threshold, trigger front...).

Some notes:
*********************************
WRITE_REGISTER  810C 0F00001 FFFFFFFF
write directly in to the register (overwrite some of the previous and following settings via individual input card):

1. 810C is the register address to be written

2. first digit is  number of active channel - 1 for coincidence (AND). E.g.: "0", only 1 channel (no coindidence).

3. last digit enables the channels (hexadecimal). E.g.: 1 = channel 0, F = 1111 (all 4), 8 = channel 3 only, 9 = channels 3 and 0.

4. Other digit would set something else that we set using individual setting cards.

If EXTERNAL TRIGGER is needed we have to comment the WRITE_REGISTER line.
